# Rule
- For new features, use branches with the prefix `feature/` and a meaningful name.
- For bugfixes, use the prefix `fix/` and a clear description of the problem.
- Never mix bugfixes and features in the same branch.
- After merging a bugfix, update feature branches via rebase/merge from develop.

# Examples
- ✅ `feature/pyodide-integration`
- ✅ `fix/tailwindcss-build-script`
