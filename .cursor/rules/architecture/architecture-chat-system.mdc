# Chat System Architecture
- Per-page, per-plugin isolation: Chats separated by page URL and plugin
- LRU Cache: In-memory cache for performance (50 chats)
- IndexedDB: Persistent storage for all chats
- Real-time sync: Cross-tab communication for chat updates
- Cleanup: Automatic removal of chats older than 90 days
