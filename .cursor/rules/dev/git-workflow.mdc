# Git Workflow Rule

**Rule:**
- Only merge into main from develop.
- All feature, fix, and doc branches must be merged into develop first, never directly into main.
- This rule is mandatory for all changes and pull requests. 

---
## Enforcement
- Local pre-push hook (.husky/pre-push) blocks direct push to main and develop.
- GitHub branch protection prevents direct push and enforces PRs from develop only.
