# Development Principle 4: Fail Fast, Fail Safe
- Early error detection: Validate at input, not during execution
- Graceful degradation: System continues working even with partial failures
- Circuit breaker: Automatic shutdown of problematic components
- Rollback capability: Quick rollback to working state
- Error boundaries: Isolate errors at component level
