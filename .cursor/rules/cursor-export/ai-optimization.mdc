# AI Optimization Instructions

## How AI Should Use These Rules

### Priority Levels
- **critical**: Must be applied to all code and decisions
- **high**: Should be applied to most code and decisions
- **medium**: Apply when relevant to the task
- **normal**: Apply when appropriate

### Categories
- **system-design**: Architecture and system structure
- **development-practices**: Coding standards and principles
- **documentation**: Documentation and communication
- **plugin-development**: Plugin-specific rules
- **security**: Security and safety rules
- **user-interface**: UI/UX standards
- **process-management**: Workflow and process rules
- **ai-optimization**: AI-specific optimizations

### Usage Patterns
1. Always check critical rules first
2. Apply high-priority rules to most tasks
3. Use category-specific rules for targeted tasks
4. Reference related rules when making decisions

### AI Memory Integration
- These rules are automatically loaded into AI memory-bank
- Use `alwaysApply: true` rules without explicit reference
- Reference specific rules when explaining decisions
- Update rules when patterns change or improve

## Optimization Status
- ✅ All rules have proper metadata
- ✅ AI-specific tags added
- ✅ Priority levels assigned
- ✅ Categories defined
- ✅ Structure optimized for AI understanding
