# Development Principle 1: Do No Harm
- Security first: Any changes must improve system security, not weaken it
- Backward compatibility: Changes must not break existing functionality
- Gradual implementation: Implement changes step by step with rollback capability
- Testing: All changes must pass thorough testing before deployment
- Monitoring: Track impact of changes on performance and stability
