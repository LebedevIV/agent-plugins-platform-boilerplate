# Testing Strategy

## Unit Testing
- Test compone.ts in isolation.
- Mock external dependencies.
- Validate error handling.
- Test security boundaries.

## Integration Testing
- Test plugin loading and execution.
- Validate.js-Python communication.
- Test integration with browser APIs.
- Check permission compliance.

## End-to-End Testing
- Test full plugin workflows.
- Validate user scenarios.
- Test extension installation and updates.
- Check cross-browser compatibility.

# Debugging GuIDElines

## JavaScript Debugging
- Use DevTools for extension debugging.
- Log message flow.
- Use breakpoi.ts for complex logic.
- Monitor WebWorker communication.

## Python Debugging
- Use print/logging.
- Test plugins in isolation.
- Use PyodIDE console for debugging.

## Common Issues
- PyodIDE startup: use loading indicators.
- Memory leaks: monitor worker lifecycle.
- Permission errors: validate manife.ts.
- Communication failures: check MCP format.
