# Development Guidelines

## JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use ES6+ and async/await.
- Modular architecture, clear separation of concerns.
- Error handling and structured logging are required.
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Prefer functional patterns where possible.

## Python (Plugins)
- Use MCP protocol for communication.
- Use async/await for I/O operations.
- Always validate inputs and handle errors.
- Plugins should be single-purpose.
- Document all plugin APIs clearly.

# Security First
- Validate manifests and permissions.
- Sanitize data between JS and Python.
- Sandbox all plugins.
- Apply the principle of least privilege.
- Audit all plugin code.

# Performance Considerations
- Lazy-load plugins and Pyodide when possible.
- Cache repeated operations.
- Monitor memory usage and clean up resources.
- Optimize bundle size and loading time.
- Use WebWorkers for non-blocking tasks.
