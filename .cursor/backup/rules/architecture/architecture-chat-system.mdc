# Chat System Architecture
- Per-page, per-plugin isolation: Ch.ts separated by page URL and plugin
- LRU cache: In-memory cache for performance (50 ch.ts)
- IndexedDB: Persistent storage for all ch.ts
- Real-time sync: Cross-tab communication for chat updates
- Cleanup: Automatic removal of ch.ts older than 90 days
