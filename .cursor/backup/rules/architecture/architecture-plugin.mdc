# Plugin Architecture
- Manifest Structure: manifest.json + mcp_server.py +.icon.svg
- MCP Protocol: Standard MCP server implementation in Python
- Permission Model: Zero Trust - plugins not trusted by default
- Isolation: Each plugin in separate worker for security
- Communication: chrome.runtime.sendMessage for all cross-component communication
