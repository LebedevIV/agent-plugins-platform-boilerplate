# AI-First Documentation Best Practice

Write all documentation, rules, and comments for both humans and AI assistants. This maximizes clarity, automation, and transferability.

## Key Practices
- Use clear, explicit logic and rationale in every rule and doc
- Prefer English for maximum AI and team compatibility
- Modularize: one concept per file, easy to link and automate
- Add metadata: description, globs, related, cross-references
- Include examples and rationale for every rule or pattern
- Cross-link to onboarding, progress, user commands, and architecture
- Update docs as you update code or automation

## Example
See [Cursor Rules System](./cursor-rules-system.md) for a full template and rationale.

## Rationale
- Enables AI assistants to reason about your project
- Reduces onboarding time for new team members
- Makes automation and search more effective
