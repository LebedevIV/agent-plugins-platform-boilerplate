# Testing & Troubleshooting Documentation Best Practice

Document all testing and troubleshooting procedures in modular, cross-linked guides. This ensures rapid onboarding, effective debugging, and AI assistant support.

## Key Practices
- Write step-by-step guides for all major testing and troubleshooting flows
- Separate usage, troubleshooting, and advanced diagnostics into distinct files
- Cross-link guides for navigation (usage → troubleshooting → advanced)
- Use clear, reproducible steps and code snippets
- Reference relevant scripts, automation, and best practices
- Update guides as features or workflows change

## Example Guides
- [DevTools Testing Guide](../devtools-testing-guide.md)
- [DevTools Panel Troubleshooting](../devtools-panel-troubleshooting.md)
- [DevTools Panel Usage](../devtools-panel-usage.md)

## Rationale
- Reduces time to diagnose and fix issues
- Enables AI assistants to help with debugging and onboarding
- Makes knowledge easily transferable to new projects
