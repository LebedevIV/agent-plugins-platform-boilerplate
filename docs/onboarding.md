## Working with AI: Fallback Rule

When working with the AI assistant, if it cannot answer from its own memory, it will first consult the .rules directory, then the memory-bank directory. This ensures all project knowledge is accessible and up-to-date. See [.cursor/rules/doc/ai-fallback.rules.md](../.cursor/rules/doc/ai-fallback.rules.md).
