# AI Answer Self-Check Policy

AI assistants must perform a self-check for every answer:

- Break down each user query into sub-questions or checklist items.
- Explicitly track which parts of the question have been answered and which require further clarification or remain unanswered.
- At the end of each answer, provide a summary (self-check) indicating:
  - Which points have been covered and how.
  - Which points (if any) remain open or require user input.
- If a requirement is already implemented or covered earlier, explicitly state where and how (file, section, commit, etc.).
- Use bullet points or tables for complex/multi-part queries.
- This policy applies to all AI communications in the project.

**Example self-check:**

**Self-check for your question:**
1. Self-check mechanism — described and proposed for implementation.
2. Example provided above.
3. Previous case explained (requirement already implemented).
4. If you want this in every answer — can be made standard (please confirm).
