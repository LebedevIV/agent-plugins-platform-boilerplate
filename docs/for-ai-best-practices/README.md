## Environment Parameters Usage

AI assistants must always use the parameters from `.cursor/rules/environment.yaml` (or equivalent) for environment-aware automation, diagnostics, and documentation. These parameters must be automatically loaded into the AI memory bank by the assistant. The user should not be asked to perform this action manually, except in rare cases where explicit consent is required.

## AI Answer Self-Check Policy

See [answer-self-check.md](./answer-self-check.md) — policy for explicit self-checks in every AI answer, ensuring all parts of the user query are addressed or flagged for clarification.
