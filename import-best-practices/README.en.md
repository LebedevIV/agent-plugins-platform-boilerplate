# import-best-practices

This directory is intended for temporary import of best practices, organizational knowledge, and AI instructions from other (more advanced) projects.

## Purpose
- Isolate imported AI materials from the current ones, preventing conflicts and accidental overwrites.
- Convenient for analysis, comparison, and adoption of new best practices.
- Safe and controlled process for integrating the best solutions.

## Structure
Copy the following folders from another project into this directory:
- `docs/for-ai-best-practices` — AI best practices (EN, for AI only)
- `memory-bank` — organizational knowledge and rules (EN, for AI only)
- `.cursor/rules` — (optional) AI rules, if you need to transfer them
- (optional) other directories with AI metadata, if used in your architecture

## How to use
1. Copy the required folders from another project into `import-best-practices`.
2. Ask your AI assistant:
   ```
   Analyze the contents of import-best-practices and integrate/supplement the best practices, standards, and organizational knowledge into the current project, avoiding duplication and conflicts.
   ```
3. After integration, delete the `import-best-practices` directory (or archive it for history).

## Important
- Do not use this directory for permanent storage — only for temporary import and analysis.
- All materials inside must be in English and are intended for AI assistants.
- For user instructions, see the `docs/` folder.
