# Active Context: Agent-Plugins-Platform

## Current Work Focus

### Memory Bank Initialization
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Goal**: Establish comprehensive project documentation
- **Scope**: Creating all core memory bank files for project understanding

### Project State Assessment
- **Current Phase**: Documentation and understanding
- **Priority**: Establish baseline knowledge of existing codebase
- **Focus Areas**: Architecture understanding, technical patterns, development workflow

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Creation
- ‚úÖ Created `projectbrief.md` - Core project requirements and goals
- ‚úÖ Created `productContext.md` - Product vision and user experience
- ‚úÖ Created `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and technical patterns
- ‚úÖ Created `techContext.md` - Technology stack and constraints
- üîÑ Creating `activeContext.md` - Current work tracking
- ‚è≥ Creating `progress.md` - Project status and completion tracking

### Codebase Analysis
- ‚úÖ Explored project structure and key files
- ‚úÖ Analyzed README.md for project overview
- ‚úÖ Reviewed package.json for dependencies
- ‚úÖ Examined manifest.json for extension configuration
- ‚úÖ Identified core components and architecture

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 sessions)
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish creating `progress.md` and `.cursorrules`
2. **Deep Code Review**: Analyze core implementation files
   - `core/plugin-manager.js`
   - `core/host-api.js`
   - `core/workflow-engine.js`
   - `bridge/mcp-bridge.js`
   - `bridge/pyodide-worker.js`
3. **Plugin Analysis**: Study existing `ozon-analyzer` plugin implementation
4. **Build System Review**: Understand Vite configuration and build process

### Short-term Goals (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Development Environment Setup**: Ensure local development works
2. **Plugin Development Workflow**: Test plugin creation and execution
3. **Documentation Enhancement**: Improve existing documentation
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Establish testing patterns and tools

### Medium-term Goals (Next 1-2 months)
1. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Expand plugin examples and templates
2. **Performance Optimization**: Improve Pyodide loading and execution
3. **Security Hardening**: Enhance security model and validation
4. **User Experience**: Improve UI and developer experience

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Pyodide Version**: Using 0.27.7 - need to evaluate if upgrade is beneficial
- **MCP Protocol**: Implementing custom MCP bridge - consider standard library usage
- **Plugin Structure**: Manifest-based approach - evaluate flexibility vs complexity
- **Worker Isolation**: Each plugin in separate worker - consider resource sharing

### Technical Considerations
- **Memory Management**: WebAssembly memory limits and garbage collection
- **Performance**: Pyodide startup time and execution speed
- **Security**: Plugin permission model and sandboxing effectiveness
- **Compatibility**: Browser extension manifest v3 requirements

### Development Workflow
- **Testing Strategy**: Need comprehensive testing approach for plugins
- **Debugging Tools**: Improve debugging experience for Python code
- **Documentation**: Balance technical depth with developer accessibility
- **Version Management**: Plugin versioning and update mechanisms

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Pyodide Performance**: Startup time and memory usage optimization
2. **Plugin Communication**: Reliable JS-Python message passing
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling across language boundaries
4. **Security Model**: Balancing functionality with security restrictions

### Development Challenges
1. **Documentation**: Comprehensive but accessible documentation
2. **Testing**: Effective testing strategies for complex system
3. **Debugging**: Tools for debugging Python code in browser context
4. **Deployment**: Streamlined plugin distribution and installation

### User Experience Challenges
1. **Plugin Discovery**: Easy plugin finding and installation
2. **Configuration**: Simple but powerful plugin configuration
3. **Feedback**: Clear status and error reporting
4. **Performance**: Responsive UI despite Python execution overhead

## Key Insights

### Architecture Strengths
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns between components
- **Security Focus**: Sandboxed execution with controlled permissions
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system allows easy feature addition
- **Standards Compliance**: MCP protocol for interoperability

### Areas for Improvement
- **Performance**: Pyodide initialization and execution optimization
- **Developer Experience**: Better tooling and documentation
- **Error Handling**: More robust error recovery and reporting
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing infrastructure

### Opportunities
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of reusable Python components
- **AI Integration**: Leverage Python's AI/ML capabilities in browser
- **Automation**: Powerful web automation capabilities
- **Education**: Platform for teaching Python in browser context
