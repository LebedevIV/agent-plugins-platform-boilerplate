# Project Brief: Agent-Plugins-Platform

## Project Overview
Agent-Plugins-Platform (APP) is a browser extension that enables sandboxed Python plugin execution in the browser using Pyodide (Python in WebAssembly). The platform provides a bridge between JavaScript and Python through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing developers to create powerful browser-based AI agents and automation tools.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. **Python Execution in Browser**: Enable full Python 3.11+ code execution through Pyodide in an isolated WebWorker environment
2. **Plugin Architecture**: Support modular Python plugins that can be easily added and managed
3. **MCP Protocol Integration**: Implement Model Context Protocol for standardized communication between JS and Python
4. **Browser Extension**: Function as a Chrome/Firefox extension with proper permissions and security
5. **Web UI**: Provide a test harness and management interface for plugins

### Technical Requirements
- **Security**: Sandboxed Python execution with controlled browser API access
- **Performance**: Efficient WebAssembly-based Python runtime
- **Modularity**: Plugin system with manifest-based configuration
- **Cross-platform**: Browser extension compatibility
- **Developer-friendly**: Easy plugin development and testing workflow

### User Experience Goals
- **Simple Plugin Management**: Easy installation and configuration of Python plugins
- **Real-time Interaction**: Live communication between browser and Python code
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear UI for plugin status and results
- **Debugging Support**: Tools for plugin development and troubleshooting

## Success Criteria
- Python plugins can execute successfully in browser environment
- MCP protocol enables reliable JS-Python communication
- Plugin system supports multiple concurrent plugins
- Extension works across different websites and contexts
- Security model prevents malicious code execution
- Performance is acceptable for real-time interactions

## Constraints
- Must work within browser extension limitations
- Python execution limited to Pyodide capabilities
- Security restrictions on browser API access
- WebAssembly memory and performance constraints
- Extension manifest v3 compliance requirements
